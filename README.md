# gb_training_org_sql

Task: 
a)  	Produce the table definitions (in SQL) for the following tables:
     	(Refer to the later queries in order to determine sensible attributes for each of these tables.)

	Course Type		
	Allocated Student	
	Current Course	
	Allocation	
	Room
	Trainer	

Remember to define a primary key and foreign key(s) where necessary. 

b)	Populate your tables with sensible data. 
(Remember you have to use this data in order to satisfy the following queries.)

      	      	
c)  	Write the SQL statements necessary to satisfy the following queries. Remember to use sensible headings where appropriate: 
       	

(Produce the SQL together with the corresponding datasheet view of the resulting output)

(1)	Produce a list of currently running courses by course code then date order.

(2)	Produce a list of courses that have ‘Introduction’ as part of their title.

(3)	List the most expensive and the least expensive course that GBT provides. Use sensible headings.

(4)	Produce a list of the number of students on each of the currently allocated courses. (This should be calculated by the query NOT held as a piece of data)

(5)	Produce a list of the current courses between two dates. Make sure you choose dates that provide MEANINGFUL output from your data.

(6)	Produce a list of the number of current courses of each type between two dates. Your output should be similar to:

	Course Code		Number of actual courses running	
	CIMW			2					
	CAMW			5
	CIES			5
	CAES			3

(7)	Produce a list of the rooms (include type of room: e.g av facilities or not) and trainers (by name) allocated to each course for each week. 
(Check your output here as this will test whether you have entered sensible data)

(8)	Produce a list of students (include student name) currently allocated to an actual course (use your data to select an actual course – E.g CIMW starting on 12/11/18)

(9) 	Produce a list of the current courses together with the total revenue that each course would have/ will brought/bring in. I.e. the number of students on each course multiplied by the number of students taking that course.
